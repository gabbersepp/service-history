# Service History

This is a free-to-use digital service history app to track all the things that were done at your car.
Initially it was a private project for one of my friends but I decided to open source the relevant parts so everyone can use it too.

See an example here: TODO: Add Link

# TODO
add remaining

first I add the tests, later on the remaining stuff from the private project
